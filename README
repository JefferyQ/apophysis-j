apophysis-j is a port in java of the famous fractal flame editor apophysis for Windows. It is based on the 
version 2.07 beta of apophysis. It should run on any machine equipped with a decent java environment (1.5 or higher) 
and bring the capabilities of this wonderful program to mac and linux users at last.
