Apophysis-j supports java plugins. You can write your own
programs by extending the existing Variation class, compile
them, and put the compiled class files into this directory:

on linux and mac :     $HOME/.apophysis-j/plugins/apophysis
on windows       :     %HOMEPATH%\.apophysis-j\plugins\apophysis


At launch time, apophysis-j scans the content of this directory
and dynamically adds all valid variations to its menu.


You can also drag and drop a compiled class file from your
desktop to the main window of apophysis-j. The program will
install it automatically into the plugin directory, and the new 
variation will be available after program restart.
