The memory needed to render an image depends upon its dimension and the
square of the oversample.  The time needed depends upon the quality.

When double-clicking on a jar file, the java virtual machine is started
with a defaut memory limit of about 60MB, which is not sufficient
to render large images.

If you want to control the memory usage, you have to launch the program
from the command line.  For example, to request a limit of 200MB:

java -Xmx200m -jar apophysis-j-NN.jar

(where NN is the version number of the program)

Currently, the only buffer type available is 32bit integers.
If the "max bits per sample" exceeds 32, it means that some counters
might overflow, and that some pixels of the final image might be wrong.
